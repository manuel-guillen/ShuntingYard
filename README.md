# ShuntingYard

An interactive demonstration of the [Shunting Yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm) for converting infix expressions to postfix.

## How to Use

Start by entering an arithmetic expression using decimal digits, parentheses, and the fundamental arithmetic binary operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`). Press `Enter` to start the infix-to-postfix conversion.

Once the conversion has started, the animation can be sped up using the `=` key and slowed down using the `-` key. The conversion processes one token at a time. To process the next token, press `Enter`.
